      This is the paragraph tags.
      </p>

      <p>Can write anything by giving <em>emphasis</em> by using these "em" tags</p>

        <p>
          We can do <b>bold</b> by simple "b" tags
          </p>

          <p>
            Also we can do <i>italics</i> by simple "i" tags
            </p>

            <p>
              I personally like the <strong>Strong</strong> tags in its wholeness.

            <h1>Heading in large size - h1 tags</h1>
            <h2>Heading in little smaller than h1 & it is represented by - h2</h2>
            <h3>Heading in little less than h2 but it is - h3</h3>
            <h4>Comparatively small size - h4</h4>
            <h5>Very small size - h5</h5>
            <h6>It is the nano size available in html & represented by - h6</h6>
